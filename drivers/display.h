  \brief Creates virtual screens
  \details Virtual screens are used to display data outside of the real screen. After creating <i>nr</i> number of screens, you can select which screen to write data to using the <i>scr_nr</i> argument available in any of the display functions:<br />
  #display_symbol()<br />
  #display_char()<br />
  #display_chars()<br />
  #display_clear()<br />

  After creating the virtual screens using this function, the screen 0 is always selected as the active screen. This means that any writes to screen 0 will actually be imediately displayed on the real screen, while writes to other screens will be saved until lcd_screen_activate() is called.
  \note Each virtual screen takes 24bytes of memory. It is less than the code that you would actually need to write to handle the cases where these functions are meant to be used. However, RAM memory on the ez430 chronos is limited too so don't use a bazilion of screens.
  \note Never, ever forget to destroy the created screens using lcd_screens_destroy() !

  \brief Displays a single character
  \details Changes the <i>state</i> of <i>segment</i> state according to bits calculated from <i>chr</i>. If no virtual screens are created, the argument <i>scr_nr</i> is ignored, otherwise it selects which screen the operation will affect.

  For example, the following line:<br />
  \code
  display_char(0, LCD_SEG_L1_3, 'C', SEG_SET);<br />
  \endcode
  Changes the bits of the 4th segment (from the right) of first line to show a 'C' character. The 'C' character is shown in the real screen.

  Another but a little more complex example:<br />
  \code
  // changes the bits of the 4th segment (from the right) of first line to show the '1' character in the real screen.
  display_char(0, LCD_SEG_L1_3, '1', SEG_SET);

  // makes all bits of the segment to blink. because only the bits corresponding to the '1' character are being shown, only the displayed '1' blinks.
  display_char(0, LCD_SEG_L1_3, '8', BLINK_ON);

  // changes the bits of the segment to show the '8' character. this operation doesn't change the blinking bits, so the displayed '8' will blink.
  display_char(0, LCD_SEG_L1_3, '8', SEG_SET);

  // turns off blinking for the bits corresponding to the '-' character. In this case because the bits of '8' were blinking, turning off '-' will make the bits of '0' continue blinking, while the '-' remains static.
  display_char(0, LCD_SEG_L1_3, '-', BLINK_OFF);
  \endcode
  \sa #display_chars()
*/
void display_char(
     uint8_t scr_nr, /*!< the virtual screen number where to display */
     enum display_segment segment, /*!< A segment */
     char chr, /*!< The character to be displayed */
     enum display_segstate state /*!< A bitfield with state operations to be performed on the segment */
     );


/*!
  \brief Displays several consecutive characters
  \details Smiliar to #display_char() except it works with a vector of chars.

  Example:<br />
  \code
  // changes the bits of the 4th to 1st segments (from the right) of the first line to show the "4321" string in the real screen.
  display_chars(0, LCD_SEG_L1_3_0, "4321", SEG_SET);

  // makes all bits of the first three segments to blink. because only the bits corresponding to the "4321" characters are being shown, only the first three displayed "432" segments blink.
  display_chars(0, LCD_SEG_L1_3_0, "888 ", BLINK_ON);

  // changes the bits of the segments to show the "8888" string. this operation doesn't change the blinking bits, so the first three displayed "888" segments will blink, while the last '8' segment is static.
  display_chars(0, LCD_SEG_L1_3_0, "8888", SEG_SET);

  // turns off blinking for the bits corresponding to the "----" characters. In this case because the bits of "888 " were blinking, turning off "----" will actually set the blinking bits to "000 ". Because the "8888" string is being displayed, only the first three "000" bits will blink, the first three "---" bits will remain static and the last segment remains static.
  display_chars(0, LCD_SEG_L1_3_0, "----", BLINK_OFF);
  \endcode
  Also, passing NULL as the <i>str</i> argument is equivalent of passing a vector of '8' characters. Consider the previous example, where the string "8888" can equivalently be replaced with NULL.
