  \brief openchronos-ng timer driver
  \details This driver takes care of the Timer0 hardware timer. From this hardware timer the driver produces two hardware-based timers running at 20Hz and 4s (period). The events produced by those timers are available in #sys_message. Beyound the fixed frequency timers, this driver also implements a programmable timer and a programmable delay.
  \note If you are looking to timer events, then see #sys_message

  \details This is a counter variable, its value is updated at 20Hz. You can use this to measure timings.

  \note You should check what modules are using this function because it cannot be used by more than one module at same time. We recommend you use one of the available fixed timers. If you really need another ticking frequency, contact the openchronos-ng developers for a better solution.

  \brief 1ms - 1s programmable delay
  \details delays execution for \b duration milliseconds. During the delay, interrupts are still generated but #sys_message only broadcasts the events after the delay has finished.
  The second argument is put directly into the _STATUS_ register. This could of course disrupt the state of the watch. Please be careful and take a look at http://mspgcc.sourceforge.net/manual/x1028.html for information regarding the _STATUS_ register.
  \note Please avoid using this. No processing is done in the background during the delay, which can have impact in modules that require a responsive system.
