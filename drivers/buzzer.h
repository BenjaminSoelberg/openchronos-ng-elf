 * The buzzer output frequency can be calculated using:

 * \brief Note type.
 * \details This is a type representing a note. It is composed by:
 * - The first 4 MSB represent the pitch
 * - The next 2 bits represent the octave
 * - The following 10 bits are the duration in ms of the note.
 *
 * There are two "meta" notes:
 * - The note xxx0 represents no tone (a rest).
 * - The note xxxF represents the "stop note" marking the \
 *   end of a note sequence.
 *
 * \note The stop note is needed in the play loop to determine \
 * when to end the melody.
