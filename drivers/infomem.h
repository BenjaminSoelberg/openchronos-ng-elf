/*
 * This driver allows applications to store data in the information memory flash
 * without interfering with each other (except for the total available memory) or
 * having to care about the characteristics of flash memory.
 *
 * infomem_ready() has to be called before any other function does work (except
 * infomem_init, but use infomem_ready to check if infomem_init is really needed).
 *
 * Single applications should only use the infomem_app_*() functions ary infomem_space(),
 * the rest of the functions should be used only in the global part of the firmware
 * (or in a dedicated application which's function it is to do memory maintenance tasks).
 *
 * Use infomem_app_replace() with count>0 to initialize memory for application. This has
 * to be redone if data of size zero was present and the application header was therefore
 * also removed (replace with zero count, clear, delete with zero offset or modify with
 * zero count and offset).
 *
 * All pointers and addresses have to be word addresses (even numbers) and all counts
 * are given in units of words (two bytes).
