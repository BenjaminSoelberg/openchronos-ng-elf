openchronos-ng - http://openchronos.sourceforge.net/

== Status ==
In progress..

This is a major rework of the entire system. For now, only this is working:
* clock (based on hardware time keeping, no more inaccuracy).
* alarm (also based on hardware).
* RFBSL wireless update.

It might not look a lot and it isn't because most of the work was done in the
core openchronos. Basically, at core level, this was what has been done:
* Implementation of a system wide message bus.
* Implementation of a RTC driver (for clock and alarm).
* Rework of timer and ports drivers.
* Implementation of a module system (drop in applications).
* Rework of the display routines.
* Rework of the menu system.

In summary, you should expect the code to be more stable, smaller and easier
to understand.
